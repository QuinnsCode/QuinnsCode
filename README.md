- 👋 Hi, I’m @QuinnsCode
-  I’m interested in cross-platform app development, game development, business automation software; basically making lives more fun and easier for everyone
-  I am most proficient in FullStack Typescript and Javascript, some Go experience with curiousity in many fun backend solutions in the works.

- Currently developing using a lot of using Redwood SDK which is taking advantage of:
- Typescript formerly Javascript
- React Server Components formerly GraphQL
- Prisma or SQL
- Cloudflare full-stack with some nice escape hatches in the works this year.
- KV, Durable Objects (don't know what they are, when to use them, or why it's even called that? contact me 😉), Queues, Workers, D1, R2.
- Realtime, scalable solutions
